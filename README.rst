This package provides python code to fit near- and mid-IR astronomical spectra
focusing on dust and gas emission features from the interstellar medium.
The original version of this code focused mainly on Spitzer IRS observations
(see below).
Exising (e.g., AKARI) and planned (e.g., JWST) observations motivates this
expanded python version.

Based on and inspired by the IDL code PAHFIT by JD Smith and Bruce Draine.
See <http://tir.astro.utoledo.edu/jdsmith/research/pahfit.php>.

This package is potentially an affiliated package of `AstroPy`_.
