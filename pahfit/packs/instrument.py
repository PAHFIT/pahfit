"""pahfit.packs.instrument

Simple interface to instrument packs, which are responsible for
defining wavelength-dependent unresolved-line resolution, and range.

Note that individual spectral ranges are called 'segments', and PAHFIT
accepts a pre-defined list of segments, as fully-qualified
heirarchical names, e.g. 'iso.sws.speed0.3a'.  For the full list of
supported telescopes, instruments, and instrument modes, see TBD.
