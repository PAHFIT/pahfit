# This is the Instrument Pack for Spitzer observations using staring
# or spectral mapping mode.  For each of the four instrument
# (Short-Low = SL, Long-Low = LL, Short-High = SH, Long-High = LH,
# with LL/SL divided into order/subslits denoted 1, 2, and 3) this
# file first provides the wavelength range covered (in microns).  The
# resolving power (lambda / delta_lambda, where delta_lamba is the
# FWHM of the resolution element) is represented by a polynomial of
# degree 3, and this file lists the coefficients CC of that
# polynomial, i.e.
#
# R = CC[0] + CC[1] * lambda + CC[2] * lambda^2 + CC[3] * lambda^3
#
# where lambda is expressed in microns as well. 
#
# Resolution data from the IRS Instrument Handbook v5.0, Section 4.1.3
# (see Figures 4.8 and 4.9).  Wave range data from the
# irs_b[0-3]_WAVECUTvN.tbl file of the CUBISM package.
