class Model:
    """This class acts as the main API for PAHFIT.

    The users deal with model objects, of which the state is modified
    during initalization, initial guessing, and fitting. What the model
    STORES is a description of the physics: what features are there and
    what are their properties, regardless of the instrument with which
    those features are observed. The methods provided by this class,
    form the connection between those physics, and what is observed.
    During fitting and plotting, those physics are converted into a
    model for the observation, by applying instrumental parameters from
    the instrument.py module.

    The main thing that defines a model, is the features table, loaded
    from a YAML file given to the constructor. After construction, the
    Model can be edited by accessing the stored features table directly.
    Changing numbers in this table, is allowed, and the updated numbers
    will be reflected when the next fit or initial guess happens. At the
    end of these actions, the fit or guess results are stored in the
    same table.

    The model can be saved.

    The model can be copied.

    Attributes
    ----------
    features : Features
        Instance of the Features class. Can be edited on-the-fly.
        Non-breaking behavior by the user is expected. Changes will be

        Parameters
        ----------
        wavelengths : Spectrum1D or array-like
            Wavelengths in micron in the observed frame. Will be
            multiplied with 1/(1+z) if redshift z is given, so that the
            model is evaluated in the rest frame as intended. If a
            Spectrum1D is given, wavelengths.spectral_axis will be
            converted to micron and then used as wavelengths.

        instrumentname : str or list of str
            Qualified instrument name, see instrument.py. This
            determines the wavelength range of features to be included.
            The FWHM of the unresolved lines will be determined by the
            value in the features table, instead of the instrument. This
            allows us to visualize the fitted line widths in the
            spectral overlap regions.

        redshift : float
            The redshift is needed to evaluate the flux model at the
            right rest wavelengths.

        feature_mask : array of bool of length len(features)
            Mask used to select specific rows of the feature table. In
            most use cases, this mask can be made by applying a boolean
            operation to a column of self.features, e.g.
            model.features['wavelength'] > 8.5
